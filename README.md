## 1. USB Microphone System Analysis

This section explains the analog front-end of a USB microphone setup and its role in signal conditioning and conversion.

**System Overview**:

- **MEMS Microphone (SPH8878LR5H-1)**: Captures sound and outputs an analog voltage signal.
- **Amplification & Filtering**: The analog signal passes through a coupling capacitor and resistor, then enters an op-amp (OPA344) for amplification and noise filtering.
- **Analog to Digital Conversion (ADC)**: The conditioned analog signal is fed into an Arduino’s 10-bit ADC.
- **Digital Processing and USB Output**: The microcontroller processes the data and outputs it as USB-MIDI to a host device.

> 🎧 This design enables real-time conversion of sound into USB-MIDI digital data using analog IC techniques.

### 🎛️ Thevenin Equivalent Model of the Microphone

To understand the microphone as a signal source, it can be modeled with its **Thevenin equivalent**:

This model helps in:
- Analyzing signal strength and loading
- Impedance matching for the amplifier input
- Ensuring minimal signal loss at the interface

### 🔧 Op-Amp Modeling as a Single Pole System

To better analyze the frequency response of the analog front-end, the operational amplifier is modeled using a **single-pole transfer function**. This provides insight into the bandwidth limitations and phase behavior of the amplifier.

## 2. High-Pass Filter Circuit

This section explains the working and transfer function of a high-pass filter using an op-amp.

<img src="Circuit Image/highpass.jpg" width="600"/>

**Circuit Overview:**

- **Input Capacitor \( C_i = 4.7 \mu F \)**: Blocks DC and allows AC signals to pass.
- **Resistors \( R_i = R_f = 5k\Omega \)**: Define gain and time constant of the filter.
- **Op-Amp**: Configured in non-inverting mode to amplify the filtered signal.

**S-Domain Transfer Function:**

H(s) = (Rf * s * Ci) / (1 + s * Ri * Ci)

- At low frequencies (s → 0), H(s) → 0 → High attenuation of low-frequency signals.
- At high frequencies (s → ∞), H(s) → Rf / Ri = 1 → Passes high frequencies with gain 1.

### 🔻 Cutoff Frequency (fc):

fc = 1 / (2πRiCi)

For Ri = 5kΩ, Ci = 4.7μF:

fc ≈ 6.77 Hz
